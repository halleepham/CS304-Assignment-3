## Program Execution Instructions for Grader:
### For Part 1 of the assignment:
- Download all the files under the folder "Part 1" (functions.cpp, functions.h, Infix_To_Postfix.cpp, Infix_To_Postfix.h, stack.h, Syntax_Error.h, main.cpp)
- Run the main.cpp file
- input an infix expression when prompted
- enter 'q' when you want to quit the program
- ASSUMPTIONS:
  - The user MUST enter the infix expression with spaces inbetween each character
  - The expression only contains numbers, operators, parentheses, and spaces
  - For example: 3 + { ( 4 * 7 ) / 2 } NOT: 3+{(4 * 7)/2}
### For Part 2 of the assignment:
- Download all the files under the folder "Part 2" (main.cpp, Queue.h)

- input and integer that corresponds with the action you would like to perform of the queue (options listed in the menu and the beginning)
- enter "0" when you want to quit the program
- ASSUMPTIONS:
  -The queue holds strings as its item type (names)
  -The program will throw an error and quit if front() or pop() is called on an empty queue
### Other Information:
- Screenshots of the output is located under "Part1Screenshots.docx" (for Part 1) and "Part2Screenshots.docx" (for Part 2)
- The reason that the stack class only has a .h file and not a .cpp is to properly define namespace KW
- The reason that the queue class only has a .h file and not a .cpp is to properly define namespace KW
